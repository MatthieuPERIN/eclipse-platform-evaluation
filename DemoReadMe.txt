To import the model you have to right click in the navigator and select "create project from imported model"
All model elements should have a distinct name.
the statechart only opens if the statemachine has a name and a comment set (known bug)

only a view state machines are working as the parser often doesn't understand the expressions.
One that is working is under:
JRU/JRU/procedure

You still must add names to all elements there.
